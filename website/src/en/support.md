## FAQs

#### Why is the download size so large?

OneQuick comes with the dotnet runtime to ensure it works on all users' computers, which results in a larger size.

Rest assured, OneQuick does not include malware and does not collect user data.

#### Purchase page crashes

Due to Windows restrictions, if OneQuick is launched with administrator privileges, the purchase page cannot be displayed.

#### I want to import the configuration from the old version

In the program's **Settings** -> **Profile** -> **Advanced**, you can find the option to import configurations.

The current version's configuration file path is:

```ps
<Users>\AppData\Local\Packages\55774JinkaiXu.252258CF1F9E6_p5dcp4q3yn5jt\LocalState\profile\profile.json
```

If you are an old version upgrade user, you can find the old configuration files in the following directories:

```
# v1.x version
<My Documents>\OneQuick\OneQuick.config
# v10.0 version
<Users>\AppData\Local\Packages\55774JinkaiXu.252258CF1F9E6_p5dcp4q3yn5jt\LocalCache\Local\OneQuick\profile.json
<Users>\AppData\Local\OneQuick\profile.json
```
