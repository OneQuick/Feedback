# Input Phrase

> Perhaps it should be renamed to "Quick Input"

If you have some content that you frequently need to input, such as email, addresses, technical terms, fixed phrases, or AI prompts, then this feature is perfect for you.

Simply type the set `input item` on the keyboard, and the program will automatically replace it with the `output item`.

For example, in the settings shown above, typing `,,g` will automatically be replaced with `your-email-address@gmail.com`.

The prefix `,,` is to avoid misjudgment, and you can set it according to your needs.

## Limitations

### Input Items

OneQuick can infer which English symbols are pressed based on your keystrokes, but it cannot obtain information you input through an IME (Input Method Editor) for Chinese or other languages.

Therefore, input items can only be English characters.

Additionally, input items cannot contain special characters such as newline or tab characters.

### Output Items

Output items can be any characters, including Chinese, Emoji, etc.

However, it currently cannot output newline characters.
