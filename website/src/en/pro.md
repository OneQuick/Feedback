# Pro Version

The differences between the Free and Pro versions are as follows:

|                      |    Free Version     | Pro Version |
| :------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------: |
|    Screen Border     | Primary Screen Only |      √      |
|     Copy Search      |       5 Items       |      √      |
|    Phrase Output     |      10 Items       |      √      |
|    Multi-Hotkeys     |       1 Item        |      √      |
|    Display Config    |      No Hotkey      |      √      |
|     Config Sync      |          ×          |      √      |
| Config Import/Export |          √          |      √      |

In daily use, the free version is sufficient for most needs. If you need more features, you can choose the Pro version.

The Pro version is subscription-based, but don't worry, it costs only as much as a meal of rice or noodles per year. The developer is a bit hungry...
