# Pro Version

The differences between the Free and Pro versions are as follows:

|               |    Free Version     | Pro Version |
| ------------- | :-----------------: | :---------: |
| Screen Border | Primary Screen Only |  No Limit   |
| Copy Search   |       5 Items       |  No Limit   |
| Phrase Output |      10 Items       |  No Limit   |
| Multi-Hotkeys |       1 Item        |  No Limit   |

In daily use, the free version is sufficient for most needs. If you need more features, you can choose the Pro version.

The Pro version is subscription-based, but don't worry, it costs only as much as a meal of rice or noodles per year. The developer is a bit hungry...
