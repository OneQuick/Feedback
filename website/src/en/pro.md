# Pro Version

To continuously maintain and update the software, we have launched the Pro version.

As one user said, **the free version is sufficient, the Pro version is better**.

In daily use, the OneQuick free version is already very useful. You are welcome to use the free version and provide suggestions and feedback.

## Feature List

The Pro version currently adopts an annual subscription model, priced at a cup of coffee ☕.
